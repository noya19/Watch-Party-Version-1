# Watch Party

Watch Party is a revolutionary platform designed to enhance the way people watch movies together online. With seamless synchronization and a host of interactive features, it's the ultimate solution for hosting virtual movie nights with friends and family.

## Key Features

### Synchronized Movie Watching

-   **Host and Participants**: Watch movies in groups with a designated host and participants in the same room.
-   **Upload Movies**: Hosts can upload movies for everyone to enjoy together.

### Seamless Control

-   **Shared Control**: When the host pauses or seeks the video, it's synchronized for all participants, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.
-   **Participant Control**: Participants can request control from the host, allowing them to pause for themselves while others continue watching. When they rejoin, the video syncs to the current point.

### Thumbnail Navigation

-   **Thumbnails**: Automatically generated thumbnails for videos. Participants can hover over the seekbar, click on a point, and request the host to seek to that moment.

### Reactions

-   **Express Emotions**: Both hosts and participants can use reactions to express their feelings about the movie in real-time, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the viewing experience.

### Integrated Chat

-   **Chat Window**: A chat window on the right-hand side lets users communicate with each other while watching the movie, making it easy to share thoughts and reactions without disrupting the viewing.

## How It Works

1.  **Host a Room**: Create a room and become the host.
2.  **Invite Participants**: Share the room link with friends and family.
3.  **Start Watching**: Upload a movie, and everyone in the room can join and watch together.
4.  **Interactive Watching**: Enjoy synchronized control, thumbnail navigation, reactions, and chat for a truly immersive movie night.

Watch Party brings the excitement of a real-world movie night to the virtual space. Say goodbye to the frustration of trying to sync up movie playback manually. With Watch Party, the movie-watching experience is not just about the film but also about the shared moments and interactions with your loved ones.
